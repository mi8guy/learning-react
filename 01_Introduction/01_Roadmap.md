# React roadmap
https://www.react.dev

## Why learn react?
- Hype, Job , trend, Building UI
- Makes easy to manage and build complex frontend.

## When should I learn react?
- After mastering JS
- Most projects don't need react in initial phases.

## Why react was created?
- Ghost message problem in Facebook. No consistency in UI.
- State -> JS and UI -> DOM, syncronization

## Don't learn react if?
- you don't know how JS works or DOM works

## React learning process
- Two methods: 
    - Go in-depth:
        Babel, fibre, Virtual DOM, diffing algo, hydration... etc
    - By making projects (one topic at a time): Todo, calculator, Github API etc...

## Framework vs Library.
- React is a library.
- Framework is something that has strict rules to follow. Compared to frameworks, react is pretty lenient in this aspect.
- Framwork is military. Library is cool dude.

## Topics to learn
- core of React (state or UI manipulation, JSX)
- component reusability.
- Reusing of componets (props)
- How to propogate change (hooks)

React ends here.

## Additional Addon to React
- Router (React doesn't have a Router)
- State management (React didn't have state management by default earlier.): 
    -  Redux, redux toolkit, zustand, context API
- Class based components:
    -  leagacy codes :disappointed:
- BASS apps
    -social media clone, e-commerce app...

<br><br>
React was never meant to be complete solution.

There are SEO issues.

As a result, frameworks like NextJS, gatsby , remix exists.
